## Description
motivation, problem, why build it, what did i learn

Starting in my web dev career I need a website my clients can use. I wanted it to to be easy to access and use, and appeal to many different people. I really struggled gitting the images to line up in my different grid space. despite that I was able to create images that would fit the space and be able to dynamically change with the use. I learned how to be more patient with myself and also how many different resources there are to look for. Even though it can be difficult, with so many places to look, and people to reach out to, I know I will continue to succeed as a web dev.
